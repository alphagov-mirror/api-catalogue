**Description**

We will use Addresses API when developing applications and services for the London Borough of Hackney. This ensures consistency and enables the linking of data across the organisation (via the Unique Property Reference Number). This API provides a limited interface to Hackney's Local Land and Property Gazetteer and to the National Address Gazetteer.

We have built Developer API Hub for anyone who is interested to build, use or expand Hackneyâ€™s APIs.It serves as a central repository for all APIs built for Hackney services. The hub also mentions if a given API is compliant with [Hackney Playbook standards](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/API-Playbook-v2-beta).
