**API Description:**

The Document Checking Service (DCS) Pilot is for non-public sector organisations that want to find out if British passports are valid.
The DCS acts as an interface between a service and HM Passport Office.
Your service sends a passport check request to the DCS.
The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office.
HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
The DCS sends the response to your service as outlined in check if a passport is valid.
