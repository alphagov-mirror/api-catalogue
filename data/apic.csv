The API will benefit these agents as it allows them to create a request for authorisation to act on a client's behalf for a specific Making Tax Digital service directly through software.-n-nThis process involves the agent providing their own personal identifier and some information about the client that they wish to act on behalf of. This generates a link that the agent can send to their client. The client can then follow this link to authorise the agent for a service.-n-nThis API will save an agent time as they currently need to use an Agent Services user interface to create an authorisation request using their agent services account.-n
